SMILES Decoder: Generative Model for Molecular Structure Prediction

# Project Description:
This project implements a generative model designed to predict molecular structures in the form of SMILES (Simplified Molecular Input Line Entry System) strings. Leveraging deep learning techniques, the model decodes SMILES strings, generating valid molecular structures that can be used in drug discovery and chemical research.
